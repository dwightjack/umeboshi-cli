## Installation

## Usage

Once installed umeboshi-cli commands are available through the `umeboshi` or `ume` executable.

**Available commands are:**

* `create`: scaffolds a new project based on a remote template
* `scaffold`: scaffolds project's folders and files based on templates
* `clean`: deletes locally stored project templates

### `create`

This command scaffolds a new project based on a remote template. The target folder must be empty.

```sh
$ umeboshi create <template> <project-folder|.>
```

Example:

```sh
$ umeboshi create base my-project-folder

# use the current folder as project root
$ umeboshi create base .
```

### `scaffold`

This command scaffolds project's folders and files based on templates.

Project's templates are stored locally. Search order is:

* `scaffold` folder in the project root
* `umeboshi-scaffold-<templatename>` local npm module

```sh
$ umeboshi create <template> <project-folder|.>
```

Example:

```sh
$ umeboshi create base my-project-folder

# use the current folder as project root
$ umeboshi create base .
```
